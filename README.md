# Song Lyrics dApp
This is my final Ethereum Developer Bootcamp project, submitted to Alchemy University, with the aim of demonstrating some skills learned in the course and obtaining a certificate of completion. The project consists of a decentralized application to register song lyrics, allowing checking ownership and creation date reference, using cryptography and blockchain network resources.
