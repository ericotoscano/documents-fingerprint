# Documents Fingerprint
This is my final Ethereum Developer Bootcamp project, submitted to Alchemy University, with the aim of demonstrating some skills learned in the course and obtaining a certificate of completion. The project consists of a decentralized application to create unique records of documents, allowing authenticity to be verified through the use of cryptographic functions.
