This is my final Ethereum Developer Bootcamp project, submitted to Alchemy University, with the aim of demonstrating some skills learned in the course and obtaining a certificate of completion. The project consists of a decentralized application for recording song lyrics, allowing the verification of authenticity and the creation of a time stamp, using cryptography and blockchain network resources.
